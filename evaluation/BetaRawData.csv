The quests which required at least two people I believe helped achieve this as it required problem solving and how to communicate clearly via the chat function. I do believe however the limited number of quests limits the potential this game could have to develop skills. ,I believe having a voice chat would help develop communication skills and I believe I could help other users more quickly and clearly. ,"As  I mentioned already the voice chat would improve the game. Additionally a friends list would be nice, so if I went back onto the game in the future I can see if a player I have already started to build an online relationship with is active as it may allow me to complete tasks more efficiently,  Then potentially you would be able to persona message specific users, so your chat is not seen by all the users active.","A bug where when I started the mountain quest I could not read the book in the church, but when I did not have a quest started it would let me read the book.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It was challenging, but I do not feel like my ability to communicate is any better.  This might be because there was only text chat?
