## Meeting #7- 30/11/2020
Due to deadline I did not have any implementation progress to show Matt. Instead I did research and started writing my literature review, so I discussed what progress I made with that and discussed different papers I found with him. He said he was hppy where my progress was so to focus on coursework for the time being.

We agreed to meet again a week on Wednesday (09/12/2020) for a general catch up, but he did not expect me to complete any firther work with my dissertation.
