## Meeting #10- 19/01/2021
Today was our last meeting back since before the crhistmas holidays. I had plenty of progress to show Matt. I showed him the new game updates and discussed what I did with my inital evaluation. We dicussed that I should try and wrap up development as I am getting near meeting most of my requirements. This is so I can focus on my final evalaution and dissertation write-up. I said I am aiming to have the code base completed for our meeting next week. He seemed happy with my progress. We also discussed how I should gatheer more qualitative data for my final evalaution as well as the SUS score I used for my initial. I will be able to compare the SUS score between the evalautions to hopefully see an increase and show i have improved my applicaiton based on user responses.

We agreed to meet next a week today on the 26/12/2021.
