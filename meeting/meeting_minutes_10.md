## Meeting #10- 18/12/2020
Today was our last meeting before christmas and I had plenty to show Matt in my progress. I showed him the new map, animated sprites, talked about how I fixed a JSON webtoken bug and showed him the in game chat. He seemed pleased with my progress over the last week. We discussed now I need to implement quests for players to complete in order for them to have something to communicate with other players about. He discussed maybe one player is one place on the map reading a book which has instructions on how to navigate a maze or puzzle oand the other player will try and complete the puzzle using these instructions as hints. I like this idea as it ensures there is a way for players to effectively work together and achieve the goal of developing communication skills. Players will still be able to complete tasks themselves via trial and error, but this means players will be rewarded by working together as they'll achieve goals faster.

We booked a meeting for early January where I will hopefully have a quest implemented and potentially of carried out an evaluation.
