Today Matt and I discussed his feedback for my requirements section. He seemed hapy with my progress but I still have to make changes with grmmar and structure. He said he would read my evaluation and get back to me. I said I would try and get the design and implementation section done for our next meeting

We agreed to meet 1 week today on the 22/03/2021
