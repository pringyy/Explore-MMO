Todat Matt talked me through my evaluation as I submitted it to him to proof read. He seemed happy with it, but pointed out at some points I was needing to be more clear and refrence a couple of things. Besides this we said I should try and finish my design chapter and background for the next meeting. 

We agreed to meet 1 week today on the 29/03/2021
