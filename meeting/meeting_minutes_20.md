Matt and I discussed my finished design and background chapter today. He said he would have a more indepth look and try and have it back to me for Friday. I also agreed I would have my implmentation done for Friday. The project is nearing its end as this was our penultimate meeting. I also asked him some queries about my background, and he suggested I more explicility said my intended contribution for this project. It would be that no MMO games have been crreated for students, specifically designed to develop communicaiton skills. Additoinally, no research has been carried out into students attitudes into games develop specifically developed for the them to develop communication skills.

We agreed to meet 1 week today for our final meeting on the 5/04/2021
