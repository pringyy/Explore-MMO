Today was the last meeting. Matt talked the through my implementation providing very insightful feedback. We dicussed how I don't need to put a lot of time into the research questions I asked about my game as my project is a software development one. I am on the final stages of my dissertation and I am very happy with it. I also thanked Matt for this time as it has been great. I was told i could send if my intro and conclusion once completed, however he said he might not have the time which is understandble. One last push!
