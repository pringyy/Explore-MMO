## Meeting #14- 08/02/2021

Today I showed Matt the reset password page and usernames now displaying above players heads. He seemed very happy with the final product! We then discused my final evaluation plan and he approved of all the methods I was doing, which is great news. We agreed I sohuld try and get 5 gtoups of two particpants to play the game and do the evaluation before the end of this week. I thenshowsed him my plan for my dissertation I breifly started writing. Again he seemed happy with this and gave me guidance on how to structure my writing. We also agreed before our next meeting I should have made a good attempt of wiritng my dissertation as the deadline is fastly approaching.

We agreed to meet 2 weeks today on the 22/02/2021 due to a week off as we have been given a reading week.
