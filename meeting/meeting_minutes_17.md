To Matt and I discussed the writ up more. We agreed I would send him chapter at a time and I asked his advice on the backgorund section. He said to me I need to find as many refrences as possible for the dissertation. He seemed happy with my progress, but still have a lot to do as the deadline is faslty approaching. I said I would try and complete some of the chapters before the next meeting.

We agreed to meet 1 week today on the 15/03/2021
