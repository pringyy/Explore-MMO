## Meeting #4- 09/11/2020

Today I demonstrated the front end working with the login/registration backend. I also showed him the in game chat. Matt is very happy with my progress and suggested I could mayve start focusing more time on my other assignments. For next week we agreed I sohuld try and integrate the backend on my chat with the backend of the main program as they are seperate dependencies right now.

We agreed to meet again next Monday (16/11/2020)
