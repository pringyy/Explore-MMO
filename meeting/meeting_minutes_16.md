## Meeting #14- 01/03/2021

Today Matt and I discussed my evaluation write up. He seemed happy with my conclusions, but empahsised I must say my results "suggest" and do not say definitely prove something. Additionally he reminded me I need to discuss the limitations of my evaluations as my friends did the study for me which coukld have resulted in more favourable results. I said hopefully I will have all chapter besides design and implemntaiton finished by our meeting next Monday.

We agreed to meet 1 weeks today on the 08/03/2021
