## Meeting #9- 09/12/2020
Due to deadlines and revising for an exam I did not have time to work on my dissertation, which Matt already expected that I would not have time. Instead we used the time to discuss the evaluation for my project. We decided I should do an inital evalaution over the christmas break or at the start of next semester and also a final evaluation. We discussed about potentially gathering data on the game players experience,so I need to research if any valid surveys to measure this exist.

We agreed to meet again a week on Friday (18/12/2020) as I will of had a week free to fiully commit my time to development and will hopefully have a lot of game progress to show him.
