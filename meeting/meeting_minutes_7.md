## Meeting #7- 23/11/2020

Today I showed Matt the maor progress I made in my project. As discussed last week I decided to scrap using a react ront end and instead use a static file approach and host the front end and back end on the same server. I showed him the new login and registration, which is now linked to the new basic game. This allos Matt and I to see each other characters moving in real time. He seemed to be impressed and we agreed I should focus for the next week on my coursework.

We agreed to meet again next Monday (30/11/2020)
