## Meeting #3- 23/10/2020

Today I took Matt through my market research and discussed the good ideas suggested by my target audience.  The response to the game was very positive and we decided it would be a good idea to implement a suggestion which would allow users to inform other users when they need help.

We then discussed my User Personas/Stories I created and I very briefly showed him my wire frames for the web page User Interface.

I then showed him my refined requirements and discuss him the research I found to justify these changes. He approved of the changes, but suggested that the language option might not need to be an absolute requirement if it would be too hard to implement. 

I then proposed  to put the writing of my literature review on the back burner, as U have done all my research and refined my requirements accordingly. He agreed with this. All I need to do is write it up at a later date, but now this will allow me to focus purely on actual development and implementation.

We then agreed to meet next Friday (30/10/2020) to discuss my progress further.
