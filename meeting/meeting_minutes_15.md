## Meeting #15- 22/02/2021

Today I sowed Matt the progress on my dissertiton, fixed Unit Tests and my final evaluation results. We discussed in details that now I have to write up my entire dissertation. This needs to be my main focus from now on. He seemed happy with my progress, so the meeting was short.

We agreed to meet 1 weeks today on the 1/03/2021
