Today I had my first meeting with my supervisor Matthew Barr. This was a meeting that involved Matt, two other students he is supervising and myself.

Firstly we introduced ourselves to each other and said what subjects we were studying this year. Matt then introduced himself and described some of his work. We then had the chance in turns to describe our intial ideas for the project, which Matt approved of so far.

I informed Matt I want my dissertation to be more project based than research based. For my next steps he told me to research into other techonologies similar to my intial idea and write a timing chart to help me plan what weeks I will be working on what.

I asked him if I could set up a skeleton program for my broswer game, where I don't implement any game features I see if I can just write code to get clients to connect to the same server. He thought this was a good idea to break up my work so I am not just fully doing research at the start of the project development.

We then sorted a time and date for our next meeting which will be a week on Friday (16/10/2020).
