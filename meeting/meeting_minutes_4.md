## Meeting #4- 02/11/2020

As I had to go into work on Friday the 30th of October, we agreed to delay the meeting until the following Monday (02/11/2020).

Today I discussed with Matt that I succefully got the back-end for the login/registration setup. We then discussed how I also got my pipeline setup. We agreed that I should demonstrate the back-end fucntionality when I get the front-end implemented. I need to try and get this done for the next meeting. I also highlighted that I am going to start implementing the chat functionality of the game this week. He seemed to be happy with my progress. We then discusssed the difference between a Computing dissertation and a dissertation in other schools in the University. I learned the computing dissertation is a lot more project based, where sciences usually are more piurely research based.

We agreed to meet next Monday (09/11/2020).
