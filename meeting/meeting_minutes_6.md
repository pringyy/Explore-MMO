## Meeting #4- 16/11/2020

Today Matt and I discussed a major set back in my development process. My frontend Phaser does not integrate well with Phaser which I am using to create the game. I did diacuss how i did prior research and I know it is possible , but from trying it myself it is a lot more work than necessary. We discussed how I am going to instead use static html files in my backend and treat the whole application as one server. This should make my development process easier. For next week I need to try and integrate phaser with my backend using this new approach.

We agreed to meet again next Monday (23/11/2020)
