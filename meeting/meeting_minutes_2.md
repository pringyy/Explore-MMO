Today I spent a quick 5 minutes demonstraiting my skeleton game to Matt. He seemed impressed with the progress, but maybe not the art! 

I then talked him through my mindmap on potential ways to take the game. We discussed how the treasure hunt idea was a good idea, having riddles and quests in which users can communicate to help each other solve them. These quests would require the user to explore an extensive map in order to complete it. We agreed this would be a strong product and if I finish it early I can additional functionality to it.

We agreed it would be a good idea to create a survey to get my end users prefrences on what they would want to be implemented into a game.

We then discussed some research I found when researching for my literature review. 

I then talked to him about what I am planning to hopefully achieve before the next meeting. This would be to create the survey, create user personas and user stories, start writing my literature review and sketch User Interface elements.
