Timestamp,Do you currently study at the University of Glasgow?,What is your age?,Have you ever played an MMO?,"I am planning to create a browser based multiplayer game which allows users to explore an extensive map. They can communicate with other players via a chat function. The game will have a series of quests in which users have to solve a riddle or complete a task to be rewarded with an item (e.g. a new skin for their avatar). Players will be encouraged to help other player complete their quests, as they might have already completed the same quest or might also be trying to complete it. The game will also be non-linear, where users will have to explore to find quests, but there will not be a strict order. Once the player has completed all the quests they will be rewarded with a special item and then will be free to explore the map, meet new people and help anyone who is stuck.Please rate this game proposal out of 10 stars.",Would you be interested in playing this game?,What features do you like the most about this game proposal?,What features do you think could be added to the game or what features would you change?

Also sometimes the in-game environment can be shockingly beautiful and detailed, and that kind of motivates me to keep playing the game.","TBH even though the quests are suppose to be non-linear, it would be still good to mark them on the map. If there’s no indication on the map at all, it can be exhausting to try to talk to all the NPCs in the game just to trigger some hidden quests. By adding the markers to the map, players can decide whether they want to do these side quests and learn more about the world/story background."

"Monday, October 19, 2020 19:33:59 AM",Yes,16-25 yrs.old,No,9.0/10,Yes,The nonlinear aspect - being able to do whichever quest you like at any time sounds like a good way of preventing the game from becoming stale.,"Allow people who are stuck to send out a request for help, and people who then go on to help the player can be given additional rewards"
